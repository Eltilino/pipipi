The VS Battles Wiki is a website that ranks fictional characters based on their power levels. The highest tier on the site is Tier 0, which is reserved for characters who can affect objects that completely exceed the logical foundations of High 1-A, which is the second-highest tier. This means that Tier 0 characters are essentially omnipotent, and can do anything that is logically possible. There are currently only a handful of characters who have been placed in Tier 0, including The Presence from DC Comics, The One Above All from Marvel Comics, and The Creator from The Elder Scrolls.

The VS Battles Wiki has been criticized for its use of Tier 0, with some arguing that it is too powerful and allows for characters to be ranked based on speculation rather than feats. However, the site's creators argue that Tier 0 is necessary to accurately rank the most powerful fictional characters.
